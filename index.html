								<h3><a href="https://github.com/BroderickBonelli/RecessionTimer">Recession Timing Model</a></h3>
								<p>Read historical VIX and ISM Manufacturing PMI data into a dataframe, and chart. Highlight dates on x-axis where the yield curve is inverted (ie: 10y yield is lower than 2y yield). The aim of this model was to see if Yield Curve inversion and the PMI had any indication of a looming vol event. My conclusion is that this is true. If the Yield Curve Inverts and the ISM is below 50, it is a reliable leading indicator of a volatility event where VIX spikes above 45.</p>
